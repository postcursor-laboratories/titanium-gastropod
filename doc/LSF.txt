An LSF (level structure file, or level save format) file is a number
of lines of plaintext, with each word on each line whitespace
separated. The first word of a line (the line type) indicates what
that line is to do. Empty lines are ok, and lines may begin with a #
to indicate a comment.

Line types:
POLYWALL
RECTWALL
ENTITY

The RECTWALL type:
RECTWALL x y theta width height friction
All numbers are floats. x, y are positions of the center of the
rectangle. Theta is the rectangle's rotation, in degrees.
